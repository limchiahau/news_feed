      "\n",
      "Apple is postponing a March event that would have seen the introduction of new products like the low-cost iPhone and iPad Pro with triple-lens camera setup, according to a source at Apple that spoke to Cult of Mac.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple allegedly became \"concerned\" about bringing people together at Apple Park for the event, said to be planned for late March. There was a rumor in February suggesting Apple would hold an event on March 31, but Apple never announced the event so there was no confirmation that it was going to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's no surprise that if there was indeed a March event planned that it has now been canceled. Yesterday, Santa Clara County, which is where Cupertino is located, banned all gatherings of 1,000 people or more. The ban lasts from March 11 to April 1, so Apple could not hold a large event in March even if it wanted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the order from Santa Clara County was said to have been a major factor in the decision to postpone the event, Cult of Mac's source also claims that there were \"delays in producing two of the primary products,\" which also led Apple to call off event plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of Apple's suppliers in China were forced to close their factories in February due to the coronavirus, which may have caused production delays on devices like the low-cost iPhone. Factories are back up and running, but are experiencing lower than normal production levels because of travel restrictions and staffing shortages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple is now said to be waiting to better evaluate the \"production schedule of components\" and \"final product assembly,\" making it difficult to determine a firm product announcement plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given Santa Clara County's ban, it's clear that there's not going to be a March event, but there have been a lot of mixed rumors on product availability and the production status of devices like the new iPad Pro and the low-cost iPhone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with no event, Apple could choose to unveil these products in March through a press release, though the aforementioned possible production issues could delay the announcements, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, which typically takes place in June, is also in jeopardy. The event normally attracts around 5,000 developers who convene at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Santa Clara County ban does not extend to June at this time, but Apple may still choose to cancel the conference given the unknowns of how the coronavirus will spread in the area in the coming weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "WWDC announcements usually come a couple months ahead of when the conference is planned to give developers time to purchase airfare and reserve hotel rooms, so it's possible we could hear about Apple's WWDC plans soon.\n",

      "\n",
      "iOS and iPadOS 13.4 can be downloaded from the Apple Developer center or over the air once the proper developer profile has been installed. On the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max, Apple requires the beta to be installed over the air using the configuration profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "iOS and iPadOS 13.4 are major updates, bringing several major new features to the iPhone and the iPad. There's a new toolbar in the Mail app that's available when viewing an email, featuring a more logical design to address complaints about the Mail layout in iOS 13.\n",
      "\n",
      "The update design moves the reply icon away from the delete icon, making it much harder to accidentally delete an email, and it adds Folder and Compose icons.\n",
      "\n",
      "iCloud Folder Sharing, designed to let users share folders in iCloud Drive with other people, is available as of iOS 13.4. iCloud Folder Sharing was first announced at WWDC last year, but it has taken Apple several months to implement it. The feature shows real-time updates so file changes will sync across the devices of all people with access to a specific folder.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are nine new Memoji and Animoji stickers included in the update, featuring emoji-style poses like shocked face, face with hearts, eyes rolling, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a subtle but important change to the way the URL bar works in Safari. In iOS 13.4, you can tap into the URL bar right away even when a URL is highlighted, which is different behavior from iOS 13.3.1. In iOS 13.3.1, an extra tap outside of a URL was required to deselect it before it could be tapped to be edited.\n",

      "There are new Settings in the TV app that are designed to allow users to control streaming and downloading over WiFi and cellular, introducing new data saving options for those without unlimited streaming plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are hints of a new CarKey API in iOS 13.4, which would allow the iPhone to be used to lock, unlock, and start a car that has NFC capabilities. This functionality hasn't been announced by Apple as of yet, but it will iPhone owners to use their devices in lieu of a car key. Sharing features will also be available for assigning keys to friends and family members through the Messages app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Code in iOS 13.4 also suggests Apple is working on an over-the-air recovery feature that would allow the iPhone and the iPad to be restored without the need for a computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though not an iOS specific feature, Apple with iOS 13.4, macOS 10.15.4, tvOS 13.4, and Xcode 11.4 is allowing developers to create apps with universal purchase support, which means Apple device users will be able to purchase one app that works across multiple platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are new controls for calls and third-party navigation apps in CarPlay, along with keyboard shortcuts for the Photos app, changes to location requests for apps requesting user location, a new Shazam Shortcuts action, options for remapping hardware keys of a keyboard connected to the iPad, and more.\n",

      "Popular to-do app Things was updated to version 3.12 today and the big change in this release is that Things on Apple Watch now syncs directly with Things Cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to this version, the Things app on iPhone has acted as the middleman for syncing between the Apple Watch app and the cloud, which could occasionally lead to out-of-date data in the Things watch app.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Things for Apple Watch now syncs directly with Things Cloud, so even if you're away from your iPhone, the watch app syncs to-dos instantly over Wi-Fi or cellular whenever they're available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developers Cultured Code say they have also improved the quality of watch face data, so that complications also remain synced and up-to-date. To take advantage of these changes, users need a Things Cloud account, which can be created for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Things Cloud, version 3.12 of the Apple Watch app brings more new features, including the ability to add new to-dos scheduled for Today.\n",
      "\n",
      "In previous versions of the watch app, new to-dos could only be saved to the Inbox, but now you have the option to set Today as the default instead. To access this setting, open the watch app and force press in the main list.\n",
      "\n",
      "The developers have also listened to feedback about the lack of an option to remove a to-do from the watch app's Today view and put it in Anytime. This can now be done by tapping Clear in the date picker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another welcome feature is scribble support, so you can now scribble instead of speaking text to add a new to-do or append some notes to an existing one.\n",

      "The report claims the app would revolve around QR code-like tags that trigger an augmented reality experience, adding that Apple appears to be testing integrations with Apple Stores and Starbucks. \"For instance, users would be able to hold up their phone in an Apple Store and view information about the products on display, get pricing, and compare features.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple today has been granted a patent for technology that could potentially be used to circumvent the issue of foldable displays creasing and cracking at the fold over time – a problem that has plagued many consumer foldable devices that have made it to market thus far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office under the heading \"System with multiple electronic devices,\" the patent describes a technology that allows two or more devices to act as one when brought close to each other through the use of proximity sensors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patent envisions separate devices automatically detecting when they're placed together contiguously and then sharing a common display image across them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Multiple electronic devices may be used together in a system,\" continues the patent. \"The electronic devices may use sensor measurements and other information to detect when an edge of a first electronic device is adjacent to an edge of a second electronic device.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As AppleInsider notes, the wording of the patent leaves open the possibility that the tech could be used to create a single bendable device comprised of two displays in seamless communication with each other, similar to Microsoft's upcoming Surface Duo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Magnetic components may hold devices together in a variety of orientations. The magnetic components may operate in cooperation with beveled housing edges and other structures to help hold devices in planar configurations in which the devices lie in a common plane and non-planar configurations in which the devices are oriented at a non-zero angle with respect to each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Foldable smartphones are undoubtedly the latest device trend, and while there are no rumors suggesting Apple has plans to release a foldable smartphone anytime soon, the company is clearly exploring their potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple has been known to be working on foldable display technology for years with patents on the implementation of similar technology. Of course, whether this research and development results in a foldable consumer product remains to be seen.\n",

      "The County of Santa Clara's Public Health Department today issued a mandatory order that requires all mass gatherings of 1,000 or more people in Santa Clara County to be canceled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Santa Clara County includes cities like Cupertino, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose, and it is the county where Apple's two main campuses are located along with many of its satellite offices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, county officials issued guidelines suggesting that companies in the area minimize or cancel large in-person meetings and conferences, but the new ban is a requirement that will prevent any major gatherings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ban takes effect at 12:00 a.m. Pacific Time on March 11 and for now, will last for three weeks. Santa Clara County is putting the ban in place as it waits for more widespread testing and for more details on how COVID-19 spreads.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a critical moment in the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in Santa Clara County. The strong measures we are taking today are designed to slow the spread of disease,\" said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County Health Officer. \"Today's order and new recommendations will reduce the number of people who develop severe illness and will help prevent our healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed. This is critically important for anyone with healthcare needs, not just those most vulnerable to serious illness from COVID-19.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The three-week ban will only last until the beginning of April, but ahead of when the mandatory ban was in place, tech companies had already started canceling events. Both Facebook and Google have canceled planned developer events set to take place in May that would have had around 5,000 attendees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple still has not made any announcements about WWDC, which is typically held in June at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California, and the length of this ban will not affect June plans, but with the growing number of coronavirus cases in the county, Apple may cancel the event as a precaution.\n",

      "\n",
      "The county's decision to blanket ban all events of 1,000 or more people comes as Santa Clara County experienced its first death due to the coronavirus. Santa Clara County has a total of 43 known COVID-19 cases, with more in other counties in the Bay Area.\n",

      "Apple is testing new iMessage features internally, according to information obtained by MacRumors. While these features could potentially arrive as early as iOS 14, they could be held back until a later software update or perhaps never released.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, there is a new Slack-like mention system that would allow users to tag other contacts with their name like @Joe or @Jane. When you type the @ sign, a list of suggested contacts would appear. This would be particularly useful in busy group chat conversations, as it would be possible to enable the \"Hide Alerts\" setting and only receive push notifications when you are mentioned directly.\n",

      "Other features in development include typing indicators in group chats, as already exists in one-on-one iMessage conversations; the ability to mark the last message of a conversation as unread after opening it; and an expansion of the \"/me\" command for sharing status updates, a feature that has been available on the Mac since the iChat days.\n",

      "Last year, developer Steve Troughton-Smith uncovered evidence of Apple working on a Catalyst-based version of the Messages app for Mac in macOS Catalina code, and a lot of the features described above would be fitting for the desktop.
